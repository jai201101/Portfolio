# Introduction
I'm a recent Astronomy graduate with hands-on experience in data analytics and data science. I've worked on academic and real world projects using tools like Power BI, SQL, Python and Excel to provide data-driven and robust solutions tailored to complex research problems and business tasks. My strong quantitative academic background has equipped me with an analytical mindset, structured approach and a strong desire to learn. I'm excited to apply my technical and transferable skills in helping businesses improve their operations and outcomes. 
# Welcome to my data portfolio
Dear Viewer, This page contains a compilation of my academic and co-curricular projects where I have used data to solve complex problems, build models, unravel insights, create interactive dashboards, etc. This github repository demonstrates my proficency in cleaning, optimizing, analyzing and visualizing data through different tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, Excel, Fortran, etc.

# Portfolio
## [Exploring PLATO’s eﬀiciency in detecting transiting exoplanets around intermediate mass stars.](https://github.com/jai201101/Portfolio/blob/main/MasterThesis)
   * **Description:**  This project tests how well European Space Agency's (ESA) PLATO space telescope can detect exoplanets around more massive, and therefore larger stars, where detection of transits is more challenging due to weaker signals. For this purpose, a simulator called PlatoSim, which can generate the expected data of PLATO has been used. This simulator replicates PLATO’s environment by inducing all the noise effects that can affect the quality and strength of the observed signal. This is a year long project with  detailed and advanced data analysis of more than 1200 different datasets each belonging to a different star-planet sytem.
   * **Fields**: Computational methods, Data Science, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Data collection, Data cleaning, Advanced statistics
   * **Skills Applied:** Python (Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, OS, TransitLeastSquares, Batman, scipy), Platosim, MESA, Bash script
   * **Thesis Manuscript:** [Jai_Mirchandani_Masters_Thesis](https://github.com/jai201101/Portfolio/blob/main/MasterThesis/Jai_Mirchandani_Master_Thesis.pdf)

## **[Cyclistic Case Study](https://github.com/jai201101/Portfolio/tree/main/Cyclistic_Case_Study)**
   * **Description:** This case study explores Cyclistic bike-sharing data over a 12-month period to uncover trends in behaviors of different user types. The objective is to compare casual vs member riders and provide actionable marketing recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members.
   * **Fields**: Data Cleaning and Processing, Data Analytics, Data Visualization
   * **Skills Applied:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, OS), SQL (BigQuery), MS Excel 
   * **Main Pdf Report:** [Cyclistic_case_study_report.pdf](https://github.com/jai201101/Portfolio/blob/main/Cyclistic_Case_Study/cylistic_case_study_report.pdf)

## **[Analysis and Evolution of a binary system with PHOEBE AND MESA](https://github.com/jai201101/Portfolio/blob/main/Binary_star_Data_Analysis)**
   * **Description:** An analysis of a semi-detached binary star system using a combination of observational data and modeling techniques was carried out in this project. The light curve and radial velocity datasets were employed to determine the system’s fundamental parameters, such as orbital period, eccentricity, and mass ratio. Through the use of sophisticated tools like the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and various estimators in the Phoebe software, we successfully derived values for the masses, radii, temperatures, and other key properties of the binary components.
   * **Fields**: Data Science, Statistical Modelling, Time Series Analysis 
   * **Skills Applied:** Python (lmfit, pandas, numpy, astrropy, Phoebe) , MESA, Fortran
   * **Main Pdf Report:** [Binary_stars_analysis_report](https://github.com/jai201101/Portfolio/blob/main/Binary_star_Data_Analysis/BIN_STAR_GROUP_G_V1.pdf)
   * **Purpose** : Binary stars Coursework project
