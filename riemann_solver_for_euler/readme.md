# Description of the project 
This project was carried out as an evaluted assignment for course on Computational methods in astrophysics course at KU Leuven.
This directory contains the code and report of simulation of Riemann problem for Euler in 1D. This projects demonstrates my ability to computationally solve complex mathematical equations and provide insightful solutions.
