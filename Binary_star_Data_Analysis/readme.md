# Project Description

This project uses PHEOBE software to model synthentic data from binary stars and unravel its physical and orbital parameters. Further, MESA software is used to model the evolution of binary stars based on the results of parameters obtained from Pheobe. This project demonstartes my ability to clean and extract valueable information from raw data using Baysean techniques.
